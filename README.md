# Kernel-Performance-Prediction
This project introduces an analytical model designed to predict the execution times of GPU kernels for unknown problem sizes without actual execution. The model considers various metrics involved in launching kernels, including problem size, block size, and grid size configurations, enabling the prediction of expected execution times.
