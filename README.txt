The GPU programs that were run to collect execution times are under the Kernels directory. To run those programs, I used the sh files, which also includes how they need to be compiled and then accordingly run.

Note that the script file iteratively runs over multiple input sizes, each size repeteadly, to get the average execution time. All these times were cumulated and the predicted execution times were calculated and related graphs were generated using a spreadsheet. It is linked below:

The report is quite comprehensive containing the methodology and the results.

Thanks!
